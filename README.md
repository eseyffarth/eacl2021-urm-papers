# eacl2021-urm-papers

This is a script that filters the list of [EACL 2021](https://2021.eacl.org/) papers down to only those for which at least one author belongs to an underrepresented group, according to the "members" section of the [BIG Directory](http://www.winlp.org/big-directory/). The list includes papers from the main conference, the demo track, and the workshops.

Previously: [acl2020-urm-papers](https://github.com/eseyffarth/acl2020-urm-papers)

## Incomplete data
The filter only outputs papers for which at least one author is found in the BIG Directory. If a paper should be found in this collection, but isn't, feel free to extend the BIG Directory to make this script more reliable!
